# Arduino-Sound-Classifier
This is my first project for IT 254, it receives audio input from a microphone and classifies that audio as either loud or quiet. Then, it sends that information to the Arduino to indicate the result with an LED.
## **Hardware & Software Requirements**
### **Hardware**
-  **PC/Laptop** (for running AI model)
-  **Microphone** (built-in or external)
-  **Arduino Mega 2560 R3** (or any Arduino with Serial support)
-  **LED** (if using an external LED)

### **Software**
-  **Python 3.9+** 
-  **TensorFlow & Librosa** (for AI processing)
-  **Sounddevice** (for microphone input)
-  **Arduino IDE** (for programming the Arduino)
-  **Teachable Machine** (for training the AI model)
